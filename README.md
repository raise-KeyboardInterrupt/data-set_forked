This is a folder of the codes working with data collected from Keithley 2450 SourceMeter. The main used of these codes are for the data analysis of I-V characteristics of diodes 
at different temperatures. This experiment is aimed to quantify the temperature dependence of breakdown in 2.7 V and 9.1 V diodes and further investigate the behaviour of Zener 
parameter β and effective band gap at different temperatures. Reverse-bias I–V curves were measured for two diodes breakdown from liquid-nitrogen temperature to 
room temperature using four-wire sensing. Breakdown was defined operationally by the threshold voltage 𝑽𝐭𝐡 at which the reverse-current magnitude satisfied ∣ 𝑰 ∣=
𝟐. 𝟎 𝐦𝐀, extracted using both fixed-current interpolation and a piecewise-linear (ReLU) knee fit to assess method dependence. The 2.7 V diode showed tunnelling-dominated behaviour: the 
fitted tunnelling scale decreased approximately linearly with temperature, 𝒅𝜷𝒁/𝒅𝑻 = (−𝟖. 𝟓𝟐𝟖 ± 𝟎. 𝟑𝟎𝟎) × 𝟏𝟎−𝟑 V 𝐊^−𝟏, 
implying a decreasing effective band-gap proxy with 𝒅𝑬𝒈/𝒅𝑻 =(−𝟔. 𝟎𝟏𝟔 ± 𝟎. 𝟎𝟐𝟏) × 𝟏𝟎−𝟒 eV 𝐊^−𝟏. The 9.1 V diode exhibited 
the opposite 𝑽𝐭𝐡(𝑻) signature consistent with avalanche breakdown, although the extracted avalanche scale was less well constrained due to increased scatter and fit sensitivity.
